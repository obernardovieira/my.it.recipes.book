# My IT recipes book

## About:
> Why should I memorize something I can so easily get from **BOOK**. <br/><br/> - Albert Einstein

>In fact, Einstein claimed never to memorize anything which could be looked up in less than **two minutes**. Therefore, that book is your **NOTE** of your life. In order to organize all the knowledge I have learned, I wrote this note for me to revise all the knowledge. <br/><br/> - aleen42

This idea came up after see [this](https://github.com/aleen42/PersonalWiki), thank you aleen42 :smile: <br/>
For a long time I've though about something like this, but never knew the best way to do it. But this is just a great idea.

I hope this book also help other people.
