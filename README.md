## About:
> Why should I memorize something I can so easily get from **BOOK**. <br/><br/> - Albert Einstein

>In fact, Einstein claimed never to memorize anything which could be looked up in less than two minutes. Therefore, that book is your NOTE of your life. In order to organize all the knowledge I have learned, I wrote this note for me to revise all the knowledge. <br/><br/> - aleen42

This idea came up after see [this](https://github.com/aleen42/PersonalWiki), thank you aleen42 :smile: <br/>
For a long time I've though about something like this, but never knew the best way to do it. But this is just a great idea.

I hope this book also help other people.
