\subsection{Copy volumes from older containers}
Anytime you need to update the running stuff on your container. How to do? Update it, then create a new container using volumes from the older one.
\begin{lstlisting}
\$ docker stop my-container \newline
\$ docker rename my-container my-old-container \newline
\$ docker run --volumes-from=my-old-container --restart always myimage \newline
\$ docker rm my-old-container
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Volumes to a specific folder}
Containers data doesn't live only inside containers, there is a copy of that on host machine. It's important to know where the containers volumes are for backup reasons!
\begin{lstlisting}
\$ docker run -v path/at/host:path/inside/container/folder my-image \newline
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Look for volumes}
Don't know where a container is saving his data? Do "\textbf{docker inspect my-container}" and look at the answer
\begin{lstlisting}[style=json]
"Mounts": [
    {
        "Type": "volume",
        "Name": "e0b4fd6(...)364830",
        "Source": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/e0b4fd6(...)364830/\_data",
        "Destination": "/var/lib/postgresql/data",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Mode": "",
        "RW": true,
        "Propagation": ""
    }
],
\end{lstlisting}
