\subsection{Rebase from another master}
Sometimes our project is a fork of another project. It's really common to happen, especially on GitHub where there is a lot of people forking others projects.\newline
But then, if you can't control de remote repository in your account like it's in your computer, how do you update it?
\begin{lstlisting}
$ git remote add other <url>
$ git fetch other
$ git rebase other/master master
$ git push
\end{lstlisting}
